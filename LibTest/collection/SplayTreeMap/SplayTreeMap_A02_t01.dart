 * Keys of the map are compared using the compare function passed in the

 * ...
 *  If the compare function is omitted, the objects are assumed to be Comparable,
 *  and are compared using their Comparable.compareTo method. Non-comparable
 *  objects (including null) will not work as keys in that case.
 * @description Checks that if compare function is not specified then key object
